Our payment model is designed to alleviate the stress of having a subscription with automatic recurrent payments.

If you are subscribed to our service you get an invitation link when it's time to pay and you have to click to confirm that you agree to pay. If you ignore the link or don't agree to pay then your subscription is cancled. This is the default. Of course, if you wish, you can explicitly enable automatic payments.

When you receive your payment invivation link you have a pre-defined period of time to complete the payment, usually a few days.
