Our plug and play philosophy ensures that your only job is to enjoy the content. Just plug the USB flash drive in your computer wait for the autorun launcher program to start. Or if autorun is disabled on your system just go the USB drive and start it manually. The launcher is designed to be as simple as possible, it's just a list of cards representing every title. Click on the title you want to launch. That's all.

Even if you opted for the digital download, it works the same way. You get a single .iso file that functions exactly like the physical USB drive. Just double-click on the .iso file and it will be mounted as a physical USB drive.
