Every month you receive a letter via standard mail. Inside is a thin, flat USB flash drive with pre-loaded digital entertainment. The flash drive is yours if you want it, but if you donâ€™t want the clutter you can optionally receive an empty return letter envelope. When you are finished using the flash drive just put it in the return envelope and drop it in the nearest post box. Returning is zero cost but makes the service more sustainable and efficient.
