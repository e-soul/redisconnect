Each month, you'll receive a letter via standard mail containing a thin, flat USB flash drive pre-loaded with digital entertainment. The flash drive is yours to keep, but if you'd prefer not to accumulate clutter, you have the option to request an empty return envelope. Once you're finished with the flash drive, simply place it in the return envelope and drop it in the nearest post box. Returning the flash drive is free of charge and helps make the service more sustainable and efficient.
