It's a surprise! ;-)

Well, yes. But here’s what we can tell you:

You'll receive a carefully curated collection of indie video games, films, music, and art. These aren’t the most popular titles, but rather high-quality, fun, and interesting works that you might not come across otherwise. The collection is built around two key principles:
- Helping users discover fresh, new content
- Giving creators greater exposure to a broader audience

Each collection is unique, though the primary focus is often on video games.
