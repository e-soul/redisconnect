It's a secret! ;-)

Well, yes. But we can still tell you this.

You get a carefully handpicked collection of indie video games, films, music, and art. You don't get the most popular titles. You get titles that are high quality, fun and interesting that you normally might not bump into. There are two key ideas:
 - the user to discover new and fresh things
 - the creators to get exposure to wider audience

The collection is unique every time. However, the focus is usually on video games.
