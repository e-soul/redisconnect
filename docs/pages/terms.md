1. **Introduction**

    Welcome to Re-Disconnect! These Terms of Service govern your use of our service and apply to all users. By accessing or using Re-Disconnect's services, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not use our services.

2. **Definitions**

    Service: Refers to Re-Disconnect’s subscription offering, including the delivery of USB flash drives and access to digital content through online download links.
    Content: Includes indie games, movies, music, digital art, and any other multimedia provided by Re-Disconnect.
    User: Refers to any person who subscribes to or uses the Re-Disconnect service.
    USB Drive: Refers to the physical device used to deliver content to subscribers.
    Subscription: Refers to the recurring payment plan associated with receiving Re-Disconnect’s content.
    Curated Content: Refers to the pre-selected indie games, films, music, and digital art provided by Re-Disconnect.

3. **Eligibility**

    To use our service, you must:

    Be at least 18 years of age or have parental/guardian consent.
    Agree to provide accurate payment and delivery information.
    Agree not to use the content for any unlawful or unauthorized purposes.

4. **Subscription Terms**

    Payment Model: By default, Re-Disconnect operates on a pay-as-you-go model. Users must explicitly approve each payment before their collection is shipped. When a new collection is ready for delivery, you will receive a payment link via email. You must complete the payment within the specified period to receive the collection. If you do not make the payment within the specified period, your subscription will be automatically canceled.

    Optional Automatic Payments: For convenience, users may opt in to an automatic payment system. With this option, your payment method will be charged automatically at the start of each new billing cycle, and your collection will be shipped without the need for manual approval. This option is entirely voluntary, and users can switch between manual and automatic payments at any time via their account settings.

    Cancellation and Modifications: If you have opted into automatic payments, you may cancel your subscription at any time via your account settings. Cancellation must be done before the next billing cycle to avoid being charged for the upcoming shipment. You can also switch back to manual payments at any time if you no longer wish to be charged automatically.

5. **Content Delivery and Use**

    Physical USB Delivery: Subscribers will receive a USB flash drive containing curated content through mail. Re-Disconnect is not responsible for delays, losses, or damages caused by postal services.

    Digital Downloads: Subscribers opting for the digital download service will receive a secure download link via email. This link will be active for a limited time and must be used within the stated period.

    Content Licensing: Re-Disconnect grants you a limited, non-transferable license to use the content for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not modify, distribute, or sell the content.

6. **USB Drive Return Option**

    Return Policy: If you prefer not to keep the USB drive, you may return it in the provided envelope after use. This helps minimize environmental waste and supports our sustainable business model.

    Recycling Commitment: Re-Disconnect encourages users to recycle the USB drives through our return system. There are no penalties for keeping the drive, but returning it supports eco-friendly practices.

7. **Ownership and Intellectual Property**

    Content Ownership: All content provided via Re-Disconnect is the property of its respective creators. You do not own the intellectual property rights to any of the content. All rights are reserved by the original creators or licensors.
